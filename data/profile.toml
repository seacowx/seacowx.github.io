I am currently a second-year PhD student at King's College London, affiliated with KCL NLP. I'm fortunate to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe" target="_blank">Yulan He</a> (primary, Department of Informatics), Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/carolinecatmur/" target="_blank">Caroline Catmur</a> (secondary, Department of Psychology), and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w-CZbj0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Jinhua Du</a> (secondary, Huawei London Research Center). My research interest is Character-Centric Narrative Understanding, Theory-of-Mind in particular. My study is supported by an EPSRC-iCASE project jointly funded by UKRI, Huawei London Research Centre, and King's College London.

Before KCL, I was a Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was supervised by Professor <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/" target="_blank">Chris Callison-Burch</a>. During my time at Penn, I worked closely with <a href="https://zharry29.github.io/" target="_blank">Li "Harry" Zhang</a>, who is currently an assistant professor at Drexel University. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Statistical Data Science at University of California, Davis, where I worked on Functional Principal Component Analysis and Curve Registration with Professor <a href="https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/people/jane-ling-wang" target="_blank">Jane-Ling Wang</a>.
